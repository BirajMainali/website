# About me

I'm **Biraj Mainali**. I build and advise on software that's clear, maintainable, and ready for real use—whether that's new products, legacy systems, or the messy middle where AI is starting to show up.

I care about **intelligent software architecture**: systems that behave predictably, scale without drama, and don't require heroics to change. I've spent years in backend and full-stack work (C#/.NET, Vue, React, PostgreSQL, message queues, APIs), and more recently helping teams figure out where and how to use AI—agents, workflows, and tooling—without the hype.

**What I do well:**

- **Backend & APIs** — .NET, C#, gRPC, message queues (e.g. RabbitMQ), and databases (PostgreSQL, SQL Server). I like systems that are observable and easy to reason about.
- **Frontend** — Vue, React, Tailwind. UIs that stay in sync with the backend and don't fight the product.
- **AI integration** — Where Gen AI fits in a product, how to build small agents and automations, and how to use AI tooling in day-to-day development without over-relying on it.
- **Configuration-first design** — Shaping behavior through config and data so that many changes don't require code deploys.
- **Mentorship & courses** — I run courses and long-form material on C#, full-stack development, and architecture so others can go deep too.

I've worked across fintech, SaaS, and product teams—often remotely—and I'm comfortable jumping into existing codebases, clarifying requirements, and helping ideas become shippable software.
